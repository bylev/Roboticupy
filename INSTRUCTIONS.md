# BASH + GIT REVIEW

In this homework you will develop two markdowns about the first two weeks of this course.

You must create a folder labeled as "robotics_programming" and start a project with `git init`.

The first markdown must be labeled as "bash_shell.md"
The second markdown must be labeled as "git_github.md"

You must commit at least five times in total and at least two days in a row. You can use your text-code editor of preference (nano, vim, visual studio code, atom, eclipse, etc.).
Also you just need to upload here the link for the github account where the files are commited.
